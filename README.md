Hi!

This repo includes: 

* May 2021 slides for licensing 

* July 2020 slides for the Licensing Hackathon

* May 2020 introduction to Creative Commons licensing for symbolic scores

* May 2019 the SIMSSA overview 

* May 2019 open source software licensing introduction. 

The repo itself is also meant to serve as an example of how one might license a combination of software, symbolic music scores, and documentation.

You can add a license to your GitHub repo following this tutorial: https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-a-license-to-a-repository
Choose the license that applies to your *software*.

This repo includes an example file (hello-simssa.py) showing how you can include the MIT license in your actual code. You should have a license for the whole repo as well as the license text in all your files. 

You can also include additional licenses (in the README and at the file level) so that you can use Creative Commons licenses for your symbolic scores and documentation. See below for example text.

### If people can't figure out if they're allowed to use your stuff, they probably won't use it! 
### That means NO CITATIONS! ;_;
